        <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9">The High School Golf Association is committed to passing on the
            great sport of golf to the next generation. Since our founding in 
            2004, we have been carrying out this purpose by making golf
            more accessible to high school students. Twenty years later,
            we are still relentlessly chasing our vision of a nation where golf
            is a highly popular sport among teenagers who will grow up to
            make valuable contributions to the game.

        <p class="col-lg-9 col-md-9">The High School Golf Association all started in 2004, when Jodene Proger,
            a fourteen-year-old avid golfer, had a problem. Her dream of playing
            on the high school golf team was crushed at her discovery that her
            school didn't have one. But Jodene did not let that stop her.
            Jodene gathered a group of young golfers like her and, after months
            of tireless work, they created a team which would go on to win
            many state championships. As word of Jodene's accomplishment spread,
            many other young golfers worked with her and the group to start more
            golf teams. As more and more teams were formed and new members were added
            to the group, Jodene gave the organization a name, the "High School Golf
            Association". After the original group graduated, they continued
            developing the HSGA by planning the first Full Swing Conference
            in their hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Using the support generated from 
            the convention, Jodene grew the HSGA team to move the organization nationwide.
            Through the support of several state athletic associations,
            the HSGA is still continuing its purpose of growing the game of golf
            through high school students twenty years later.
