        <h1 style = "text-align: center;">Coldplay</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Coldplay is my favorite band because
        they have so much amazing music that is so unique from other
        artists. My favorite of their songs is "Fix You" because I really
        like the message and the bass guitar solo by my favorite member,
        Guy Berryman, is really awesome. However, Coldplay has so many
        other hits, such as "Viva La Vida", "Yellow", "A Sky Full of Stars"
        , "The Scientist", just to name a few. In conclusion, Coldplay
        is my favorite band and I believe that they will go down in
        history as one of the greatest musical groups of the twenty-first
        century.
