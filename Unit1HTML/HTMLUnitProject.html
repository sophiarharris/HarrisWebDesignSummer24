        <h2>Understanding Browsers</h2>
        <div>
        <h3>Introduction to Browsers</h3>
        <p>Simply put in an article by Margart Rouse, a web browser is "a
            software program that allows a user to locate, access, and
            display web pages". Web browsers are very important to
            accessing information on the internet; without them,
            it wouldn't be possible to display information from all over 
            the web on a user's device. However, this wasn't always such
            an easy action. In fact, when web browsers were fist
            developed in the 1990's, they could only be used on certain 
            computers. Back then, people were awestruck at the concept of
            an email, but now world leaders are compelled to discuss
            limitations on technological advances of browsers in the
            interest of privacy.</p>

        <h3>How a Browser Works</h3>
        <p>In short, a browser uses a software called a rendering agent to
            retreive code from an internet-connected server and to
            translate it into images and words.The browser then displays
            the translated code on the user's device, allowing them to
            easily interact with the web page. However, not all browsers
            interpret the format of the code in the same way. Because of
            this inconsistency, web standards are necessary to ensure
            that all users have the same experience on a website.

            <h6>Source: DuckDuckGo. 2008. DuckDuckGo.com (https://duckduckgo.com)</h6>
            <h5>Pros</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the most secure web browsers</li>
                <li>Allows the user to set their cookie preferences
                    one time to avoid pop-up cookie permission inquiries
                    on individual websites</li>
                <li>Faster load times due to this browser's ability to
                    block trackers, which usually take a while to set 
                    up</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Duck Duck Go automatically blocks advertisements,
                    but a lot of websites make money solely from them.
                    Therefore, if Duck Duck Go becomes a popular browser,
                    companies may have to charge users to open their
                    websites.</li>

        <h3>Privacy Concerns and Solutions</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest privacy concerns for web users are cookies.
            Cookies are files stored by a website which contain information
            gathered from your activity on that website. They play a role
            in web browsing because companies can use data collected
            in cookies to personalize your experience on their website.
            This is done by doing things such as serving you
            advertisements about things that you previously viewed. Cookies
            cause many privacy concerns for web users, mainly because
            of a specific type of cookie, called a third-party cookie.
            Normally, cookies are only stored within the website that uses
            them, however, third-party cookies contain data which was
            collected from another website and sold to a new one.
            Therefore, the company which purchased the cookie can use data
            gathered from the user's activity on the previously vistied
            website to personalize their experience. This buying and
            selling of a user's information across the web is the reason
            why many people try to limit their web activity. Because of
            this, many browsers have made security tools available for
            their users. Chrome, Safari, and Edge all have a private
            browsing mode which does not save any information about
            the user's activity. Additionally, Chrome and Edge have
            ad-blocker extensions availabe. This eliminates one of the ways
            that websites can use cookies. Duck Duck Go is one of the best
            options for privacy-seeking web users because this browser
            allows the user to block all cookies. This browser also 
            automatically blocks advertisements. In summary, cookies are 
            major privacy concerns on the web, and many browsers are
            taking actions to make their applications more secure.

    <h2>Webpage Rendering</h2>
    <ol>
        <div>
        <h3><li>URL</li></h3>
        Example: www.example.com/information.html
        <br>
        <p>A URL is an address that tells the browser where to find the web
            page the user is looking for. This is why URL stands for
            "Uniform Resource Locator". You may have also seen a URL that
            can be clicked on and automatically opened. This is called a
            hyperlink. You see, a hyperlink is simply the clickable
            element and a URL is the address itself that the browser reads
            and uses. A URL consists of two parts: domain and path. The
            domain, "www.example.com" in the example above, indicates the 
            location where the user's requested resource can be found. The
            second part of a URL, the path, which is "/information.html" in
            the example, tells the browser which specific resource of the
            website the user wants to use. As a user navigates between
            pages on a website, the domain will stay the same, but the path
            will change because the resource being viewed will be different.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3><li>Request</li></h3>
        <p>After the user enters the URL, the browser uses it to send a request
            to a the server specified in the domain, which is in this case,
            "www.example.com". This request asks the server to send the 
            user the resource that they asked for, which is contained in 
            the path of the URL, which is "/information.html". 
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3><li>Response</li></h3>
        <p>The server then responds to the browser's request by sending
            the requested resourse, "/information.html" to the user's 
            browser in HTML form. This means that the resource will not
            be sent in the same format as the user would view it. Rather,
            the resource is sent in code.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3><li>Rendering</li></h3>
        <p>Now that the browser has the HTML file of the requested
            resource, it must translate the code using a rendering agent.
            The HTML code contains the structure of the web page, telling
            the browser exactly what should be displayed on the user's
            device. Once the HTML is rendered, the resulting web page
            can be viewed and interacted with by the user.
